# Transition Arithmetic Entropy
An **analogous approach to arithmetic entropy** could be adapted for **transition matrix entropy (TME)** to handle ties more effectively. The idea would be to preserve the presence and significance of **repeated transitions (ties)** in the sequence rather than artificially breaking them or letting them dominate. Here's how such an approach might work conceptually:

### **Adapting Arithmetic Entropy for Transition Matrix Entropy**

#### Key Ideas:

1. **Preserve Information About Ties**:
	- Instead of treating ties (e.g., $Wheat→Wheat$) as generic self-loops, encode these transitions with **explicit patterns** that differentiate ties from other transitions.
    - For example, repeated transitions could be given unique weights or symbols based on their frequency or position in the sequence.
    
2. **Reduce Combinatorics**:
       - Similar to arithmetic entropy, avoid combinatorial complexity by encoding transitions directly as numeric representations. This could simplify handling sequences with ties while maintaining interpretability.
       
3. **Incorporate Context-Specific Weights**:
       - Assign weights to transitions based on their significance to the system (e.g., ecological impacts of monocultures). This ensures that repeated transitions are neither overemphasized nor ignored.

### **Proposed Method: Transition Arithmetic Entropy (TAE)**

#### Step 1: Encode Transitions

- Represent transitions between states as **integers or symbols** that reflect their type:
    - $A → A$ (self-loop/tie)
    - $A \rightarrow B$ (cross-transition)

- For example, in a crop rotation sequence $[Wheat, Wheat, Corn, Soybean, Corn]:$
	- Transitions: $[Wheat \rightarrow Wheat, Wheat \rightarrow Corn, Corn \rightarrow Soybean, Soybean \rightarrow Corn]$
	- Encode as symbols: $[T_1, T_2 T_3, T_4]$,
		- $T_1$ = self-loop
		- $T_2, T_3, T_4$ = cross-transitions
#### Step 2: Assign Numerical Values to Transitions
- Replace each transition type with a unique integer or weight that reflect is **rank or significance** in the sequence. 
- Example:
	- $Wheat \rightarrow Wheat$ = 0
	- $Wheat \rightarrow Corn$ = 1
	- $Corn \rightarrow Soybean$ = 2
	- $Soybean \rightarrow Wheat$ = 3
- This preserves information about transitions while making ties explicit. 
#### Step 3: Create an Integer-Based Encoding
- Convert the sequence of transitions into a **numeric representation**: 
	- Use a positional numeral system, similar to arithmetic entropy $(AE)$
	- For embedding dimension $D = 3$, consider triplets of transitions (e.g., $T_1, T_2, T_3$).
- Example :
	- Transitions $[T_1, T_2, T_3]$ = $[0,1,2]$
	- Numeric representation (base-$D$): $N = 0 \cdot D^2 + 1 \cdot D^1 + 2 \cdot D^0 = 5$
#### Step 4: Calculate Probabilities of Numeric Patterns
- Count how often each numeric pattern occurs in the encoded transition sequence. 
- Example: 
	- Numeric patterns: $[5, 10, 15, 5]$,
	- Probabilities: $P(5) = 2/4, P(10) = 1/4, P(15) = 1/4$.
#### Step 5: Compute Transition Arithmetic Entropy
- Use the Shannon entropy formula to compute entropy for the numeric patterns:
$$ H = -\sum P(N_i) \cdot \log_2 P(N_i) $$
- This entropy reflects the complexity of transitions, accounting for ties explicitly.
### **Advantages of Transition Arithmetic Entropy (TAE)**

1. **Explicit Handling of Ties**:
    
    - TAE treats ties as meaningful transitions rather than forcing artificial interpretations (e.g., strict self-loops or ignored ties).
2. **Contextual Flexibility**:
    
    - Weights can be customized to reflect the significance of certain transitions in the system (e.g., penalties for monocultures, rewards for diverse rotations).
3. **Efficient Representation**:
    
    - By encoding transitions as integers, TAE avoids the need for combinatorial calculations, making it computationally efficient.
4. **Improved Discrimination**:
    
    - TAE can distinguish between systems with similar transition patterns but different tie frequencies or structures.
