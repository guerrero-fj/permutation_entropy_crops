# Spectral Entropy Analysis for Streamflow and Evapotranspiration

**Date**: 2025-05-08

---

## Objective

To derive entropy-based weights for use in multi-objective optimization of SWAT 
model outputs. We compute **between-band spectral entropy** for streamflow and 
evapotranspiration (ET) time series, capturing the distribution of variability 
across hydrologically meaningful time scales.

---

## Method Summary

### 1. Preprocessing

- **Log-transform** the data to reduce skewness and emphasize relative variability.
- **Demean** the time series to center around zero.
- **Apply Hann window** to minimize spectral leakage.

### 2. FFT and Frequency Bins

- Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the power spectrum.
- For streamflow (daily resolution), compute frequencies in **cycles/day**.
- For ET (8-day resolution), compute frequencies in **cycles per 8 days**.

## Frequency Bands

### Common Hydrologic Time Scales:

| Band | Period (Days) | Streamflow (cycles/day) | ET (cycles/8 days) |
|------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | 1–10          | 0.1 – 1.0                | 0.8 – 8.0           |
| 2    | 10–60         | 0.0167 – 0.1             | 0.133 – 0.8         |
| 3    | 60–180        | 0.0056 – 0.0167          | 0.044 – 0.133       |
| 4    | 180–730       | 0.00137 – 0.0056         | 0.011 – 0.044       |
| 5    | >730          | 0 – 0.00137              | 0 – 0.011           |

## Entropy Calculation

1. Compute total power within each band.
2. Normalize the band powers to form a probability distribution.
3. Compute **Shannon entropy**:
   \[
   H = -\sum p_i \log_2(p_i)
   \]
4. Normalize entropy:
   \[
   H_\text{norm} = \frac{H}{\log_2(n)}, \quad n = \text{number of bands} = 5
   \]

## Results

### Streamflow
- Dominant power in seasonal–interannual band (6–24 months)
- Normalized entropy: **~0.85** (moderate complexity)

### Evapotranspiration
- Very strong concentration in 6–24 month band
- Normalized entropy: **~0.28** (low spectral diversity)

---

## Applications

- Use normalized entropy values as **weights** in SWAT multi-objective calibration.
- Higher entropy = greater information richness = more calibration priority.
