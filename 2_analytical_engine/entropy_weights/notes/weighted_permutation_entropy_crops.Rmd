**Title: Calculating Weighted Permutation Entropies for Multi-Objective
Calibration in Environmental Models**

**Objective:** To quantify the temporal complexity of crop yield time
series in a way that reflects both the unpredictability of the data (via
permutation entropy) and its structural importance (via information
gain), for use in calibration weighting alongside other variables like
ET and streamflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conceptual Basis:**

In environmental model calibration, we often need to combine multiple
objectives into a single weighted function. Crop yield, ET, and
streamflow are common calibration targets. However, their contributions
to overall system dynamics differ in both structure and temporal
variability. To properly reflect these differences:

-   **Permutation Entropy (PE)** captures the temporal complexity or
    unpredictability of a time series.
-   **Information Gain (I)**, based on the Johnston & Semple (1983)
    method, reflects the structural contribution of a variable by
    quantifying the inequality in its distribution across time.

While PE alone tells us about the randomness in ordering patterns, and I
alone tells us how much a variable contributes to the overall yield
structure, their combination gives us a more holistic measure of how
important and complex each variable is.

To enable cross-variable comparison, all entropy-derived metrics are
**normalized to the [0, 1] range**, including permutation entropy,
spectral entropy, and the coefficient of variation (CV) of annual
spectral entropy. While entropy is traditionally expressed in bits,
normalization allows us to treat these measures as **unitless indicators
of system complexity**. Thus, normalized entropy, information gain, and
CV of entropy can be combined and interpreted consistently within a
multi-objective calibration framework.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Procedure:**

1.  **Compute Permutation Entropy** for each crop yield time series:

    -   For a time series $X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$, select an
        embedding dimension $m$.

    -   Identify all consecutive overlapping segments of $m$ values.

    -   Count the frequency of each unique ordinal pattern (permutation)
        among these segments.

    -   Compute Shannon entropy over the resulting pattern distribution:

        $$ PE = -\sum_{k=1}^{m!} p_k \log_2(p_k) $$

    -   Normalize by dividing by the maximum entropy $\log_2(m!)$:

        $$ PE_{norm} = \frac{PE}{\log_2(m!)} $$

2.  **Compute Information Gain (I)** for each crop type:

    -   Normalize crop yields by year so that each yearâ€™s yield
        proportions sum to 1:

        $$ Y_{ij} = \frac{\text{Yield of crop } j \text{ in year } i}{\sum_j \text{Yield in year } i} $$

    -   Compute the mean proportion of each crop over all years:

        $$ Y_j = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_{ij} $$

    -   Compute the inequality (information gain) for each crop:

        $$ I_j = Y_j \sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_{ij} \log_2(N Y_{ij}) $$

3.  **Compute Weighted Permutation Entropy** for each crop:

    -   First, normalize information gain values across all crops:

        $$ w_j = \frac{I_j}{\sum_j I_j} $$

    -   Then, compute the weighted permutation entropy:

        $$ PE_{weighted,j} = PE_{norm,j} \cdot w_j $$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interpretation:** - $PE_{weighted}$ reflects both **how complex** a
crop's temporal pattern is and **how much that crop contributes** to the
system's structural variability. - These entropy values can then be
compared directly with spectral entropies for ET and streamflow. -
Optionally, the inverse ($1 - PE_{weighted}$) can be used to assign
calibration weights that favor more predictable or informative patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Publication-Ready Summary:** To synthesize crop-specific temporal
complexity with structural contribution, we propose a composite entropy
metric referred to as *weighted permutation entropy*. For each crop
yield time series, we first calculate the normalized permutation entropy
$PE_{norm,j}$ based on ordinal patterns of a chosen embedding dimension.
Separately, we estimate the information gain $I_j$ for each crop based
on its relative concentration across years using the Johnston and Semple
(1983) formulation. By normalizing these values to obtain relative
weights $w_j = I_j / \sum_j I_j$, we compute the final weighted entropy
as: $$ PE_{weighted,j} = PE_{norm,j} \cdot w_j $$ This quantity captures
the extent to which each crop exhibits temporal disorder, weighted by
its structural dominance in the yield record, and can be compared
directly with spectral entropies from continuous time series like ET and
streamflow in multi-objective calibration strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Use Case:** This method provides a defensible and transparent way to
prioritize calibration targets not just by their volume or variance, but
by their **informational structure**, which is crucial when capturing
dynamic responses to long-term climate variability.
