# permutation_entropy_crops
ðŸšœ Permutation Entropy Crops ðŸŒ¾ (R-based Analysis) Analyze crop rotation sequences using Arithmetic Entropy (AE) &amp; Transition Arithmetic Entropy (TAE) in R. Quantify local/global complexity, handle ties, and compute a combined entropy metric for sustainability, soil health, and climate resilience.
