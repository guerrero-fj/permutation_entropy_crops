🚜 Permutation Entropy Crops 🌾 (R-based Analysis)
A computational framework for analyzing crop rotation sequences using Arithmetic Entropy (AE) and Transition Arithmetic Entropy (TAE) in R. This project quantifies local and global complexity in crop sequences to assess sustainability, environmental impact, and resilience in agricultural systems. 🌱📊

🔹 Features:
✅ Compute AE for local variability in crop sequences
✅ Compute TAE for transition complexity between crops
✅ Calculate a Combined Entropy Metric based on Euclidean norm
✅ Handle ties in crop sequences for accurate entropy estimation
✅ Support for custom crop scoring (climate resilience, soil health, pest resistance)
✅ Provide visualizations and comparative insights using R

📌 Applications:
🔬 Sustainable Agriculture | 🌍 Environmental Analysis | 📊 Comparative Farming Studies
